Lab 1: Scanner
--------------

- data types could also be valid identifiers, meaning they will match for both rules with equal length
    - we placed the identifier rule last so data types will have higher precedence

- integers can overflow into negative values causing comparisons to MAX_INTEGER to provide invalid results
    - using an unsigned long in C avoids this problem, can use strtoul to detect and report overflow, preventing undefined behaviour

- operators which consist of multiple characters (>=, !=, etc.) need to be returned to Bison as defined tokens
    - single character operators can and have been defined using their literal ASCII values instead of defined tokens

- QUESTIONS

    - Q: don't floats require a max length? What is it?
        - A: not defined in spec, can define our own

    - Q: are underscores allowed? Is __ a valid identifier?
        - A: yes, can follow full GLSL spec, which permits this

    - Q: can the defined macros change? Do we have to cover cases where the macro's value exceed's C's representation of an integer?
        - A: yes they can change, no we don't have to cover these cases
            - we don't have to handle overflowing the variables for MAX_INTEGER comparison

- KNOWN ISSUES

    - integer and float values are compared against macros MAX_INTEGER and MAX_FLOAT but if the variables used overflow => undef. behaviour
        - no overflow protection library used currently
        - unsigned long overflows at value ULONG_MAX
            - 2E+64-1 = 18446744073709551615 on developer computer, may be 2E+32-1 = 4294967295 on other computers
        - float overflows on developer computer at value FLT_MAX
            - 3.402823E+38 = 340282346638528859811704183484516925440.000000 on developer computer
